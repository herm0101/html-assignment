    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>When I graduated, I took a gap year to figure out where I wanted to go and what I wanted to study. This led me to choose Algonquin and enrol in the "Interactive Media Design" program. Although I'm still not sure if this is what I truly want, my goal in life isn't to become super rich; instead, it's to lead a happy life and be surrounded by people who care about me.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and listening to music. I mainly listen to hip hop but I don't mind other genres as well. One thing many people don't know about me is that I am actually half-Asian. My mother was born in Cambodia and moved to Canada when she was little.</p>
