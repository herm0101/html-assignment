    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        When I graduated, I took a gap year to figure out where I wanted to go and what I wanted to study. This led me to choose Algonquin and enrol in the "Interactive Media Design" program. Although I'm still not sure if this is what I truly want, my goal in life isnt to become super rich; instead, it's to lead a happy life and be surrounded by people who care about me.

        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies and listening to music. I mainly listen to hip hop but I dont mind the other genres as well. One thing many people dont know about me is that I am actually half asian. As my mother was born in Cambodia and moved to Canada when she was little.
